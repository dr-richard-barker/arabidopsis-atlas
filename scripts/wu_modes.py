"""One ion mode per Wu 2018 metabolite, shared by every script that reads wu_leaf_identified_long.csv.

Wu et al. (2018) report some metabolites in both positive and negative ion mode, and the two modes'
intensities sit on different levels (7-methylthioheptyl glucosinolate: control positive-mode median
16.7, stress negative-mode median 26.0). Choosing a mode per accession or per condition mixes those
levels inside one column or across a stress - control difference. So the mode is chosen once per
metabolite: a mode measured in both conditions (negative first), else each condition's own mode.

`stress_unpaired` names the metabolites whose stress - control difference is not like for like and
must be left out of stress responses:
  - no ion mode shared by the two conditions;
  - listed on more than one row of Wu Table 2 (D-Galactonic acid as C6H10O7 and C6H12O7; Guanosine
    2':3'-cyclic monophosphate at two retention times), so control and stress can come from
    different peaks.
Within-condition statistics (ranks, percentiles) can still use these metabolites.
